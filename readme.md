# GitHub Repository for Image Classification using InceptionV3

This GitHub repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`image_classification_inceptionv3.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to perform image classification using the InceptionV3 model and the TensorFlow/Keras framework. The notebook guides you through the process of training a deep learning model to classify images into one of the predefined classes. Below, you will find an explanation of the key components and steps in the notebook.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
In this notebook, we use the InceptionV3 pre-trained model for image classification. We walk you through the process of fine-tuning this model on your own dataset. The notebook includes code for data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
This section contains all the necessary imports and installations for the libraries used in the notebook. Make sure to have TensorFlow and other required packages installed before running the notebook.

## Data Preparation <a name="data-preparation"></a>
In this section, we load and preprocess the dataset for training. The dataset should be organized into folders, where each folder corresponds to a class. The `getFeaturesArray` function is used to load and preprocess the images, and it returns the data and labels.

## Model Architecture <a name="model-architecture"></a>
Here, we define the model architecture using InceptionV3 as a base model. We add custom layers on top of the pre-trained model to adapt it for our specific image classification task. The model is compiled with suitable parameters.

## Model Training <a name="model-training"></a>
This section covers the training process of the model. It includes splitting the data into training and testing sets, and then training the model using the `fit` method. Various training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs are defined.

## Model Evaluation <a name="model-evaluation"></a>
After training, the model's performance is evaluated using the test set. You'll find code for evaluating accuracy and plotting training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs.

## Results and Analysis <a name="results-and-analysis"></a>
The notebook concludes with an analysis of the results. It provides classification reports and other evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance on your dataset.

Please follow the notebook (`image_classification_inceptionv3.ipynb`) for a detailed step-by-step explanation of the code and a hands-on guide to image classification using InceptionV3. Enjoy experimenting with your own image classification task!
